The main goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use and efficient Employee Management System that helps organizations manage employee records digitally. Many companies still rely on manual methods like paper files or spreadsheets to store employee data, which can lead to errors, data loss, and difficulty in finding or updating information. To solve this problem, we have developed a computerized system using Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface and MySQL Workbench for managing the backend database.
This system allows administrators to add, update, view, and delete employee details with just a few clicks. It reduces paperwork and saves time by storing all the records in a structured database. The system ensures that each employee has a unique ID, and their data—such as name, role, and other details—is stored safely in the database. Java Swing/AWT helps us create user-friendly forms and buttons for interacting with the system, while MySQL Workbench helps in storing, retrieving, and modifying the data efficiently.
Another key objective is to improve the accuracy and security of employee data. With this system, there is less chance of mistakes like duplicate records or missing information. It also limits access to authorized users only, which means that only admins can manage the records.
In summary, this project aims to:
· Replace manual employee data handling with a digital system.
· Make employee record management faster and error-free.
· Provide a secure and reliable way to store and access employee information.
· Use simple technologies like Java Swing/AWT for the front-end and MySQL Workbench for the backend to make the system easy to build and maintain.
